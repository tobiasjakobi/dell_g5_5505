# Pictures of the Dell G5 5505 heatpipe

The Dell G5 5505 laptop is notorious for its poor thermal performance, which is due to low-quality thermal paste and pads. Replacement of the thermal paste is easy (recommendations e.g. include Arctic MX4), but replacement of the thermal pads is complicated due to a multitude to different pads used. The pictures illustrated which pads have what thickness. In total we have 0.5mm, 1mm, 1.5mm, 2.0mm, 2.25mm, 2.5mm and 4mm pads in this system.
